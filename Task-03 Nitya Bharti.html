            <p style="font-size: large;font-family:cursive;color:darkblue;"><b>Republic Day is of great historical importance to the
                 country. On the 26th of January, 1950, the nation first implemented the Constitution. Jawarharlal Nehru was elected  
                 President for the Indian National Congress, and Poorna Swaraj or Independence day was declared on the 26th of January,
                 1930. However, in the real sense, we got Independence on the 15th of August, 1947. Due to the historical importance of
                  the day, the 26th of January was declared Republic Day.

                From the 26th of January, 1950, India celebrated its Republic day on that day. The day is declared as a national holiday. 
                On the occasion of Republic Day, the President of the country hoists the National Flag, following which the national anthem 
                is sung. There are celebrations held at the Rajpath near the India Gate in the country.It marks the day when India became
                truly independent and embraced democracy.</b> </p>
